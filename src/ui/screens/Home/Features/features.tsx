          With the function-per-file style, you can pick just what you need and
          stop bloating your project with useless functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          It works well with modern module bundlers such as{' '}
          <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>Browserify</strong>, or{' '}
          <strong>Rollup</strong> and also supports tree-shaking.

      <>
        <p>
          date-fns doesn't reinvent the wheel and uses the existing native type.
          Also, it doesn't extend core objects for safety sake.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functions in date-fns work predictable and stick to ECMAScript
          behavior in edge cases.

    title: 'Immutable & Pure',
    description: (
      <>
        <p>
          date-fns is built using pure functions and always returns a new date
          instance instead of changing the passed one.
        </p>

        <p>It allows to prevent bugs and skip long debugging sessions.</p>

        <p>
          date-fns supports both <strong>Flow</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The typings are generated from the source code and bundled with the
          package, so they always up-to-date.

        The functional programming submodule provides a better alternative to
        chaining â€” composition, which makes your code clean, safe and doesn't
        bloat your build.

    title: 'I18n',
    description: (
      <>
        With the support of an amazing community, date-fns have dozens of
        locales. But none of them will be included in your build unless you use
        that.

        <p>
          It always returns a date in the same time zone, no matter what's
          passed, a timestamp, a string or a date object.
        </p>

        <p>
          The API is tailored to have predictable names and arguments order.

        <p>date-fns respects timezones & DST.</p>

        <p>It follows semantic versioning so, always backward compatible.</p>

        <p>
          Each build CI checks more than 650&nbsp;000 examples in about
          400&nbsp;time&nbsp;zones.

    title: 'Simple',
    description: (
      <>
        <p>
          The best API is an API that doesn't exist. With date-fns you always
          have one function that does one thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The API is unambiguous, and there is always a single approach to a
          problem.
